# Forecasting Commodity Net Export Price Index (CNEPI) Using ARIMA Models

**Group Project**

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting the Commodity Net Export Price Index (CNEPI) for Sri Lanka** using **ARIMA time series models**. The CNEPI is constructed by weighting individual commodity prices by their net export share relative to GDP.

The **main objective** of this project is to build a **simple and easily interpretable model** so that the **business community** can use it to make effective decisions. All data analysis processes are performed using **R**.

This project was conducted as part of the **Research Methodology course unit**. We applied research methodology principles rigorously throughout the project. Since this was done at the beginning of our third year, we initially had **no theoretical knowledge of ARIMA models**, but through extensive **self-study**, we learned the correct methodology for ARIMA modeling. This process significantly **improved our report writing and research skills**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Components

- **Data preparation:** Cleaning and organizing raw commodity price and trade data into a tidy dataset suitable for analysis.  
- **Exploratory analysis:** Understanding trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data.  
- **Time series modeling:** Applying ARIMA models to forecast future CNEPI values.  
- **Model evaluation:** Assessing model accuracy using standard metrics and visualizations.  
- **Reporting:** A comprehensive LaTeX report detailing methodology, analysis, results, and insights for policy and trade decisions.  
- **Presentation slides:** Summarizing key findings and forecasts for easy communication.
